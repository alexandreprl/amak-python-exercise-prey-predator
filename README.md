<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Exercise

The goal is to implement a simulation of a prey-predator ecosystem.

The wolves eat the sheeps to gain lives, die if they run out of lives and can reproduce. 

The sheeps eat the grass to gain lives, die if they run out of lives and can reproduce.

The grass grows at a fixed rate and can be eaten by the sheeps only when fully grown.
